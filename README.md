## Hello, I'm Diogo Moreira! 👋🏻

Brazilian, based in Cajazeiras, PB, Brazil.
I’m a Professor at [Instituto Federal da Paraíba](https://ifpb.edu.br), Brazil since 2014, and I do research in the Software Testing/Quality area. Among my recent work, there is an article on [Metamorphic Testing on Acoustic Scene Classifiers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176773), published in IEEE AITEST 2020.

Besides my professional life, I like to spend my time photographing 📷 (as a hobby), playing videogames 🎮 and writing the articles I post in my [blog](https://diogodmoreira.com/blog). There, you can read about my musings on life, software development, technology and so forth.
