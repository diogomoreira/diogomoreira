## Hello, I'm Diogo Moreira! 👋🏻

Brazilian, based in Cajazeiras, PB, Brazil.
I work as a Professor at [Instituto Federal da Paraíba](https://ifpb.edu.br), Brazil since 2014, and I do research about Software Testing/Quality. You can find my academic profile at [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1803-6565), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?hl=pt-BR&user=DlSdlvEAAAAJ) or [Lattes (pt-br)](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4384159A1)

Besides my professional life, I like to spend my time photographing 📷 (as a hobby), playing videogames 🎮 and writing.
